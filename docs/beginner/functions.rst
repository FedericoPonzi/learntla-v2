Structures
============

Sequences cover tuples and arrays, now we need something to represent string hashmaps. In TLA+, this is the struct:

::

  struct == [a |-> 1, b |-> {}]


You index structs the same way you do sequences so ``struct["a"] = 1``. You can also write it in a more "object" like with a dot instead: ``struct.a = 1``.

.. troubleshooting::

  If you get

  | Encountered ``"|->"`` at line X, column Y and token ``"\"key\""``,

  It's because you wrote ``["key" |-> val]`` instead of ``[key |-> val]``.


Unsurprisingly, structs are mainly used to represent organized collections of data. For example, a TK might consist of an TK.

.. some kind of exercise

Just like sequences, sets, and primitive values, we want some way to generate sets of structs, so we can stick them in our type invariants. Here's how:

::

  StructType == [a: S, b: T] \* make better

This is the set of all structures where ``s.a \in S /\ s.b \in T``.

.. troubleshooting::

  If you get

  | Attempted to compute the number of elements in the string "val"

  *at model-checking time*, it's because you wrote ``[key: "val"]`` instead of ``[key: {"val"}]``.

.. index:: DOMAIN
.. _domain:

DOMAIN
--------

If I wanted to find all of the values of a *sequence*, I could get it like this:

::

  RangeSeq(seq) == {seq[i]: i \in 1..Len(seq)]

How can I get all the values of a structure? ``Len`` isn't defined for structures. Instead, we have the special keyword ``DOMAIN``. ``DOMAIN struct`` is the set of all keys of a structure.

::

  RangeStruct(struct) == {seq[key]: key \in DOMAIN struct}

Try this out.

Now for the fun bit. What happens if we pass a *sequence* into ``RangeStruct``?

::

  >>> RangeStruct(<<"a", "b", "a">>)

  {"a", "b"}

...Huh. ``DOMAIN seq == 1..Len(seq)``! In fact, it's actually *the other way around*: ``Len`` is defined in terms of DOMAIN!

.. .. exercise:: MyLen
  :label: mylen

  Write ``MyLen(seq)``, which returns the length of seq, without using ``Len``. You may need ``Max(set)``.

  .. Max(DOMAIN seq)

Here's the punchline: *both sequences and structures are just syntactic sugar*. TLA+ has only two "real" collections: sets and functions. Sequences and structures are both particular classes of functions, the ones that we as programmers are most familiar with. It's time to finally introduce the true data type.


.. index:: function

.. _functions:
.. _function:

Functions
===============

First of all, throw away the programming definition of "function". The closest thing TLA+ has to a programmatic function are operators. A :dfn:`function` follows the *mathematical* definition, a mapping of values in one set to another set.

::

  F == [x \in S |-> expr]

The set we're mapping from, ``S``, is the :dfn:`domain` of the function, and can be retreived by writing ``DOMAIN F``. That's why we could also use ``DOMAIN`` with sequences and structures:

1. A sequence is just a function where the domain is ``1..n``.
2. A struct is just a function where the domain is a set of strings.

But functions are a more general than that, and can map *any* set of values. For example, we can have pairs of numbers in the domain of the function.

::
  
  Prod == 
    LET S == 1..10 IN
    [p \in S \X S |-> p[1] * p[2]]

  \* Prod[<<3, 5>>] = 15

.. tip::

  You can also write that as ``Prod == [x \in S, y \in S |-> x * y]``, or ``G == [x, y \in S |-> x * y]``. You can also call the function with ``Prod[3, 5]`` and leave out the angle brackets. 

  (Internally, TLA+ will represent it as a tuple, so ``DOMAIN F = S \X T``.)

.. .. exercise::

  Write ``Double(seq)``.

  ::

    Double(<<1, 2, 3>>) = <<2, 4, 6>>

  .. 

I like using functions to show me the results of an expression for various inputs. For what values of P and Q is ``P => Q`` true?

  ::

    TruthTable == [p, q \in BOOLEAN |-> p => q]

If you run this in `scratch <scratch>`, you'll get the results, though they'll be in an unusual format:

.. code-block:: text

  ( <<FALSE, FALSE>> :> TRUE @@
  <<FALSE, TRUE>> :> TRUE @@
  <<TRUE, FALSE>> :> FALSE @@
  <<TRUE, TRUE>> :> TRUE )

This is in "expanded form": ``x :> y`` is the single-valued function mapping x to y (so ``[s \in {x} |-> y]``), and ``@@`` merges two functions. If the two functions share a key, then ``@@`` **keeps the value on the left**.

Using Functions
-----------------

Why functions over operators? We rarely use functions for computationsâ€” operators are far superior for that. Functions are important as *values*. We can assign them to variables and manipulate them like any other value.

In a spec I once wrote, I had to assign tasks to CPUs. Some tasks needed to be assigned to many CPUs, but each CPU should only have one task. In that spec, the best solution was to store assignments as functions, where each task mapped to a set of CPUs.

::

  variables
    assignments = [t \in Tasks |-> {}] 

Then I could write ``assignment[t] := assignment[t] \union {cpu}`` to assign ``cpu`` to task ``t``. For my invariant, I said no two tasks shared a CPU assignment.

::

  OnlyOneTaskPerCpu ==
    \A t1, t2 \in Tasks, c \in CPU:
      /\ (t1 # t2) 
      /\ c \in assignments[t1] 
      => c \notin assignments[t2]

We could also write this invariant by noticing that "tasks don't share cpus" is the same as saying "assignment sets are disjoint":

::

  OnlyOneTaskPerCpu ==
    \A t1, t2 \in Tasks:
      (t1 # t2) 
      => assignments[t1] \intersect assignments[t2] = {}

.. index:: function; function sets

.. _function_set:
.. _function_sets:

Function sets
----------------

You know the drill by now: new class of value, new need for a way to generate sets of that value. We need to add function values to our type invariants, too!

The syntax for function sets is ``[S -> T]`` and is "every function where the domain is ``S`` and all of the values are in ``T``." In the prior task example, ``assignments`` was always a function in the function set ``[Tasks -> SUBSET CPUs]``. I could also have represented the state with functons of form ``[CPUs -> Tasks \union {NoAssignment}]``.

I can also use `set maps <map>` and filters here. Let's say a task can only be assigned to at most two CPUs. If I wanted to, I could fold that into the type invariant, using a function set::

  TypeInvariant ==
    \* ...
    /\ assignments \in 
      LET LeqTwoCPUs == {set \in SUBSET CPUs: Cardinality(set) <= 2}
      IN [Tasks -> LeqTwoCPUs]

Though in this case I'd prefer to keep the type invariant simple and write a second invariant with the additional restriction::

  TypeInvariant ==
    /\ assignments \in [Tasks -> SUBSET CPUs]

  AnotherInvariant ==
    \A t \in Tasks: Cardinality(assignments[t]) <= 2

Some more examples of function sets: 

#. We have a set of servers, which can have one of three states. Then ``status \in [Server -> {"online", "booting", "offline"}]``.
#. We represent a directed graph as a function on pairs of points, which is true iff there's an edge between the two points. Then ``graph \in [Node \X Node -> BOOLEAN]``.
#. If we define the previous set as the operator ``GraphType``, we could get the set of all *undirected* graphs with ``{g \in GraphType: \A n1, n2 \in Node: g[n1,n2] = g[n2,n1]}``.
#. Integer addition, as in "two plus two is four", is an element of the function set ``[Int \X Int -> Int]``. However, while this is expressible, TLC cannot enumerate this set.

.. troubleshooting::

  If you get

  | Encountered ``"|->"`` in line X, column Y

  In a function set, then you probably wrote ``[S |-> T]`` instead of ``[S -> T]``. Similarly, if you get

  | Encountered "->" in line X, column Y

  In a function, then you probably wrote ``[x \in S -> T]`` instead of ``[x \in S |-> T]``. Don't worry, everybody gets the two mixed up at some point.

.. .. exercise::

  Given the sets ``Servers`` and ``StatusType == {"on", "off", "booting"}``, find the set of all status configurations where at least one server is booting.

  ::

    {config \in [Servers -> StatusType]: \E s \in Servers: config[s] = "booting"}

Sorting
.........

Let's put function sets to good use. We `learned before  <issorted>` that we can write ``IsSorted(seq)`` as:

::

  IsSorted(seq) ==
    \A i, j \in 1..Len(seq):
      i < j => seq[i] <= seq[j]

Now what about an operator that *sorts* as a sequence? Specifically, one such that ``IsSorted(SortSeq(seq))`` is always true. That's easy:

::

  Sort(seq) ==
    <<>>

We had to tweak the definition a bit and make sure that the output sequence has all the same elements, too. 

Now you might remember from our discussion of `CHOOSE` that instead of manually constructing the sequence with the desired properties, it's easier to instead take a set of sequences and pluck out the one that has the properties we want.

We know we can get the set of elements in a sequence this way:

::
  
  Range(f) == {f[x] : x \in DOMAIN f}

Then ``[DOMAIN seq -> Range(seq)]`` is the set of all sequences which have the same elements as ``seq``. Our operator will then look something like this:

::

  Sort(seq) ==
    CHOOSE sorted \in [DOMAIN seq -> Range(seq)]:
      /\ \* sorted has the same number of each element as seq
      /\ IsSorted(sorted)

To figure out if two sequences have the same number of each elemnet, let's define a ``CountMatching(f, val)`` operator that tells us the number of inputs matching ``val``. To get the size of a set, we need ``Cardinality`` from the `FiniteSets` module.

::

  CountMatching(f, val) ==
    Cardinality({key \in DOMAIN f: f[key] = val})
    
::

  Sort(seq) ==
    CHOOSE sorted \in [DOMAIN seq -> Range(seq)]:
      /\ \A i \in DOMAIN seq:
        CountMatching(seq, i) = CountMatching(sorted, i)
      /\ IsSorted(sorted)

Let's try this on some input:

::

  >>> Sort(<<8, 2, 7, 4, 3, 1, 3>>)
  <<1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8>>

The Duplicate Checker Again
...........................

Last time, I promise.

Our last version of the duplicate checker was this:

.. spec:: duplicates/constant_2/duplicates.tla

Currently we can control the value of ``S`` per model, it would be good if we could control the length of ``seq`` too. Then we can test both 2-element sequences and 20-element sequences. But currently the length is hardcoded by the number of ``\X`` cross-products we used.

We can simplify this with function sets. ``S \X S \X S`` is going to be a set of 3-tuples. We now know that a 3-tuple is a function with domain ``1..3``. Then ``[1..3 -> S] = S \X S \X S``: the set of all 3-tuples where each element of each tuple is a value in ``S``.

From this, extending this to five-element sequences is trivial :ss:`duplicates_len_5_seqs`:

.. spec:: duplicates/fs_1/duplicates.tla
  :diff: duplicates/inv_4/duplicates.tla

Notice now that, while ``S \X S \X S`` has a *hardcoded* length, ``[1..3 -> S]`` is based on a *value* â€” the size of the domain set. This means we can pull it into a constant!

.. todo:: Pull into a constant





.. tip:: State Sweeping

  *State sweeping* is when we use an initial starting state variable to control the parameters for other variables. For example, we could have one variable determine the length of an input sequence, or the maximum size of a bounded buffer.

  .. spec:: duplicates/fs_2/duplicates.tla
    :diff: duplicates/fs_1/duplicates.tla

  Now, instead of checking all length 5 sequences, we're checking all length 5 *or smaller* sequences :ss:`duplicates_len_5_or_less`! This is a useful specifying trick known as *state sweeping*.

  Strictly speaking, sweeping isn't *necessary*: we can, with sufficient cleverness, construct a complex operator that does the same thing. Sweeping, however, is often much *easier* than doing that, and frees up your brainpower for the actual act of specification.


Summary
===========

* Functions map a set of values to another set of values. They are written ``[x \in set |-> Expr(x)]`` and called with ``f[value]``.
    * Functions can also be written ``[x, y \in Set1, z \in Set2 |-> P(x, y, z)`` and called with ``f[a, b, c]`` (or ``f[<<a, b, c>>]``).
* The domain of a function, the set we're mapping from, is ``DOMAIN f``.
    * ``a :> b`` is the function ``[x \in {a} |-> b]``.
    * ``f @@ g`` merges ``f`` and ``g``, **preferring keys in f**.
* Sequences are just a special kind of function, where the domain is ``1..n``. 
* Structures are another special kind of function, written ``[key1 |-> val1, key2 |-> val2]``. They are called with ``struct["key1"]`` (or ``struct.key1``).
* Functions and structures both have special set syntax. For structures, it is ``[key1: set1]``. For functions, it's ``[A -> B]``.
