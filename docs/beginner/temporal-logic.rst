.. invariants aren't really part of TLA+. There's no concept of an "invariant" that's treated as special by TLA+. The model checker, TLC, gives us that, but more that's due to pramgatics and efficiency than "invariants" being something deeply important. Rather, TLA+ provides a *general principled* way to write all kinds of different properties, where invariants are just one of many things we can check. To write these, we a set of :dfn:`temporal operators` to describe logical statements across time. We call the broad class of all properties :dfn:`temporal properties`.

There are two kinds of temporal properties: "safety" properties say our system doesn't do bad things. "liveness" properties say our system always does a good thing. "We do not violate any database constraints" is safety, "All transactions either complete or roll back" is a liveness property. All invariants are safety properties, but not all safety properties are invariants. For example


.. orchestrator spec

"There is at least one server that's always online" could mean one of two thigns:

1. At any given point in time, there is at least one server online.
2. In every behavior, there is a particular server, and *that* server is online at all points in time.

(1) is a standard invariant. (2) is a safety property, but **not** an invariant. There is no individual state, by itself, that would violate it. Say I give you the state ``online = {1}``. Is that a violation? *Only* if, in the behavior, there's another state where ``1 \notin online``. So we can't just look at a single state to know if we've broken (2) or not.

TLC can check (2) as a temporal property. To do this we'll need a new operator.

.. index:: []
  :name: always

[]
-----

``[]P`` means that ``P`` is true in every state. When on the outside of a predicate, this is equivalent to an invariant, and in fact is how TLC supports them: writing ``INVARIANT P`` is the same as writing ``PROPERTY []P``. 

Things get more interesting when ``[]`` is part of a larger expresion. Writing ``[]P \/ []Q`` means every behavior has either P or Q as an invariant, but doesn't need to have both. Or we could write ``[]P => []Q``, to say that P is a *stronger* invariant than Q: We can also put it inside quantifiers. To properly model (2), we could write::

  ``Safety2 == \E s \in Servers: [](s \in online)``

At the beginning of the behavior, we pick one online server. That server is then *always* online. 
.. note:: this is evlaauted at hte beginnieng of hte temporal poperties, which is why it's ewird if you leave the square out.



.. tip:: tripwire properties

  I'm not going to go into the exact semantics for *how* it works just yet, but ``[](P => []Q)`` says that Q can be false *until* there's a state where P is true, and then Q must be true forever after. This is a tripwire.


.. =>

In summary, adding ``[]`` to the language lets us represent all invariants, and a host of other properties too.


Stuttering and Fairness
------------------------

``[]`` is just a logical operator, like any other, meaning we can combine it with other logical operators. ``[]~P`` means that P is always not true. ``~[]P`` means that P isn't *always* true. There are two things that could mean:

1. In every behavior, there is at least one state where P is false
2. There is at least one behavior which has at least one state where P is false.

Version (1) is more often useful in specs, so that's what ``[]~P`` formally means. If we write::

  \* It's not the case that all servers are always online
  Liveness == ~[](online = Servers)

This is a *liveness* property, not a *safety* property. In order to satisfy ``Liveness``, the behavior has to *reach* a state where the server is offline.

We'd expect that to pass. The orchestrator can do one of two things: remove an existing server from ``online`` or add one that's not in it. So if all the servers start online, then eventually we'll remove one, right?

.. index:: stuttering
  :name: stuttering

Not so fast! There's a *third* thing the orchestrator can do: it can crash. In TLA+, any behavior is allowed to :dfn:`stutter`, or make a new state where nothing happens and all variables are unchanged. This includes stutter-steps, meaning any behavior can stutter infinitely, aka crash. And that's exactly what we see if we run the spec with ``PROPERTY <- Liveness``:

.. todo:: trace

.. note:: Why haven't we see this before? Because up until now we've only had invariants, which are only violated by "bad states": partiuclar configurations of variables that break the invariants. Stutter steps don't change the values of anything, so a stutter step can never break an invariant. Here's the first time it can break things by *preventing* us from reaching a good state.

TLA+ allows infinite stutter steps because it is fundamentally a worst-case scenario language. IN reality, systems always crash. If we do not *explicitly say* a system can't crash, TLA+ will assume the system can crash at the worst possible time.

So we need a way to say "don't assume this system can crash". We do this by saying it's a :dfn:`fair process`.

.. spec

This makes the process :dfn:`weakly fair`: it cannot "stop forever". Once we add this change, we see ``Liveness`` holds. There's also **strong** fairness. But this easier to explain (and more useful) in pure TLA+, as opposed to PLusCal. I'll leave the PlusCal material in an advanced topic here.

.. .. advanced-topic:: Strong Fairness

.. tip::
  
  Not every process in a spec needs to, or should be, fair. Consider a spec where one process represents the worker and one represents a user. The user actions aren't *guaranteed* to happen: the user can always step off the computer and go outside.

.. todo:: make an advanced-topic directive that's either a dropdown or a popout. And it should do an include

.. todo:: explain difference between stutter and an action that does nothing. It matters for deadlocks only

Liveness
===============

Take the following spec and translate it to TLA+:

.. spec:: termination/1/counter.tla

Simple spec. At this point should be able to epxress that when the algorithm finishes, x = 3. Here's a spec that *also* guarantees the invariant "when the spec finishes, x = 3": 

.. spec:: termination/2/counter.tla

If we never reach the end state, then it doesn't matter what we say about the end state, it's always gona be true! In fact, there isn't a single invariant that (1) will pass that (2) won't also pass. 

But there are properties that are only true of (1), they're just not invariants. For example, (1) will eventually run to completion, while (2) runs forever. In other words, (1) **terminates**. This is not an invariant because it isn't a property of individual states of the spec. Rather, it's a property of individual *behaviors*: each behavior is guaranteed to completion.

We can learn how to specify this by looking at the TLA+ translation of the spec. Near the very end you will see this line::

  Termination == <>(pc = "Done")

.. index:: <>

The key difference is the ``<>``. It's sometimes called the "diamond operator", but more often **eventually**. ``<>P`` means that "at *some* point, ``P`` is true". It could be true right now, or it could be true 10,000 steps from now, but it will *eventually* be true.

This makes Termination a **temporal property**.

With an invariant violation, TLC finds a behavior that eventually reaches a *bad state*. With ``Termination`` violation, TLC finds a behavior that's doesn't reach a good state. For this reason we often call these "Safety" and "Liveness" {{}}. Since these are checked in different ways, we put them in different sections of the model checker. You'd put ``Termination`` under "Temporal Properties".

.. warning:: Leaving out the temporal mode

If we run this on (2), we get the following error:

  Temporal properties were violated.

.. note:: Due to historical implementation details TLC cannot tell us which temporal property is violated, but this is something we want to fix in the near future.

``Termination`` successfully shows that (2) never completes. Just to be on the safe side, let's run the same property on (1) and confirm it works.

.. todo:: Find a clean way to introduce liveness term

  Temporal properties were violated.

...huh. So (1), despite *obviously* being a complete spec, is failing the same check. Let's look at the error trace.

State 1: x = 0

State 2: x = 1

State 3: x = 2

State 4: x = 3

State 5: Stuttering

.. index:: stuttering
.. index:: stutter-invariance

Stuttering and Fairness
-----------------------


To understand what's going on here, I need to provide a bit of context.

You might have noticed that all of our specs so far are in a single file. Unlike with programming, composing specifications is *very* difficultâ€” not just in TLA+, in *all* specifications languages. One of the things that makes it (*somewhat*) easier is **stutter-invariance**. A "stutter-step" is when a behavior has a state "transition" that leaves all the values unchanged. If you can insert a stutter step between *any* two steps without it breaking your spec, then your spec is "stutter-invariant". All TLA+ specs are stutter-invariant by definition: it's baked into the language formalism. We'll talk about how this happens 

You may think this is weird, but it ends up being extremely useful. "The program stutters forever" could represent the computer crashing, or a response never returning, or the computation simply taking much longer than our time scale. [#scale]_ Above all, TLA+ asks us to be *explicit* about what we mean. So if we want to assume an algorithm doesn't crash, we have to explicitly *declare* the algorithm doesn't crash.

In Pluscal, we can make an algorithm *must* make progress if it can writing ``--fair algorithm`` instead of ``--algorithm``. This makes the spec weakly fair. More specifically, if a weakly fair action is always enabled, it eventually happens.

.. spec here

We can also make individual processes weakly fair, by writing ``fair process``. In the following spec, ``<>(x = 3)``.

.. spec here

.. rubric:: Strong Fairness


I said ``fair`` makes the algorithm *weakly* fair. Most of the time, weak fairness is what you need. But we have anothr shade of fairness called *strong* fairness. To see why the distinction matters, let's jump to a different example for a little bit. This is a variation of the `threads` specs we wrote back when talking about concurrency.

.. spec here

Both threads are weakly fiar: if they can always make progress, they are guaranteed to make progress.


Liveness Properties
====================

``<>`` is useful on its own, but to really reach the full potential of temporal properties, we need one more operator.

Here's a simple specification for a clock:

.. spec

Unlike our previous specs, we *do not* expect this one to terminate. We do, however, expect it to keep looping through every possible hour value. It should reach ``hour = 0`` an infinite number of times. How do we express that as a property?

You might try ``<>(hour = 0)``, but this only says that we're at midnight *at least once* in every behavior. If the clock ticks past midnight *and then stops*, ``<>(hour = 0)`` is still satisfied. We want to instead say that ``hour = 0`` an *infinite number of times*. Or, more formally, at every point in a behavior, there is a future state where we're at midnight. If we tick past midnight, there must be another future state where we're back at midnight again.

.. index:: []

Speciying this requires the other temporator: ``[]``, or "always". ``[]P`` means that P is true in every state of every behavior. On its own ``[]`` is not that useful to use, because saying ``[]P`` is a property is the same as saying ``P`` is an invariant. 

.. note:: Technically speaking, ``<>`` is defined in terms of ``[]``: ``<>P == ~[]~P``.

.. exercise:: Show that ``[]P == ~<>~P``.

  .. First define ``Q == ~P``. ``<>Q == ~[]~Q``, ``~<>Q == []~Q`` ``~<>~~Q == []~Q``, ``~<>~P == []P``.

But *combine* it with ``<>`` and we get a lot more power. ``[]<>(hour = 0)`` means "at all points in every behavior, there is a future point where the hour is midnight," which is exactly what we want. You can read the ``[]<>`` as "always eventually".

We can also combine things the other way. ``<>[](hour = 0)`` means "eventually, there is a point where it is forevermore midnight." Check that our spec fails this. ``<>[]``

.. exercise:: Explain *informally* why ``<>[]P => []<>P`` (if P is eventually always true, then it is always eventually true.)

  .. Blah blah blah



Putting it into practice



.. [scale] If an algorithm is supposed to take 10ms to run, then infinite stuttering could represent it completing in 1000x the time, or 10s.
