In this chapter we will cover

- concurrency
- processes
- await
- deadlocks
- either

- procedures

So far we've only worked with single-process algorithms.


.. index:: process
  :name: process

.. _processes:

Processes
=============


Processes

.. tip:: ``pc`` *can* be used in `define` blocks.

.. warning:: variables local to processes *can not* be used in `define` blocks.


.. index:: await
  :name: await

await
---------

deadlocks
...........

local variables
----------------


Nondeterminism
=================

either-or
----------

with
-----------

Example
============

Procedures
-----------

*Note: this is both fairly complicated and fairly niche, so feel free to skip this and come back to it later.*
