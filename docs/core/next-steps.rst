Congratulations! You've reached the end of the core. You're now a TLA+ expert.

Okay, okay, that's not true. There's a lot more to TLA+ than just the syntax and semantics. We haven't talked about model optimization, or design patterns, or how to use it as part of a development process, or how to run it from the command line. And the examples we used were all toy problems. What does modeling a real world spec look like?

In other words, how do you get *good* at TLA+?

First of all, there's the rest of the site to help you with that. The :doc:`topics section </topics/index>` is all about advanced TLA+ use: design considerations, general tips, how to use the tooling better. And the :doc:`examples section</examples/index>` is a collection of operators and specifications for you to study.

.. note:: Both of these are a little, um, *aspirational* right now. There's only six topics written (of about 15), and right now the examples page is mostly just a link to other examples around the web. Check the `whatsnew` page for updates!

Beyond that, there's plenty of material around the web! You can check out the :doc:`other resources </reference/other-resources>` page for links.

.. todo:: What's next as topics

I hope you enjoyed learning TLA+!
